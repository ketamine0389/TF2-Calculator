but there would be the first mode which only keys/refined values can be entered (and the other 2 options are still calculated), 
but then for the second mode, usd values can be entered and converted to keys, but it also converts (and can be inputted for) 
usd after fees and keys after fees (low/high/avg/current), with the fee % also being an inputable number. It would take the usd fee % number to get the key fee % numbers
okay basically to sum up what i want for that, fees are only applied when selling for usd, so. okay to go over my thought process 
lets say i buy for 14 keys and sell for $30 (before fees). i calculate what the sell revenue is (28.5), and then i take that number 
and find how many keys i get when i buy keys at a high/low/current/avg number. i then take those numbers and subtract each of them by 
the buy # (in keys), to see the profits for high/low/current/avg. if i buy in usd and sell in keys then reverse the process. there are no fees for buying in usd 
basically i need to see how much i would make in usd and keys (with keys in current/high/low/avg (chla)) when i can input either k/$ for buy/sell
Also profit calculator would be "separate" from the conversion calculator, except they both use the values from the key (the stuff in the box)
And also the fees in profit calculator dont need to be there, i forgot to remove that (cause the number put there would be after fees) 
And after looking at all this holy shit i do a lot of math for this shit
Quality of life ideas, color differentiation for profit numbers (like green grey red gradient)
Oh also would it be easy to convert it to html after?

2 Modes: Key prices -> USD & USD -> Key prices
(1 key = ref/lowusd/highusd/currentusd)
